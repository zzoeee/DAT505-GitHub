## The function of my project
It is a brush which consists of a word called opinion that shows different colours randomly.The colourful words will appear on the canvas continuously when you press your mouse while the words stop appearing when you release your mouse.

## The concept of my project
I have made the artistic work as my final project which aims to display a phenomenon of information explosion on the Internet.

Nowdays, people are free to comment on current issues and show their views to everyone on the provided platform of Internet. It is undeniable that these views consist of a more pluralistic society. However, there are still some problems have to be noticed. Most opinions are similar because of most people's cognitive limitation derived from similar educational experience.Then, These opinions are gathered together and turned into a trend which mainly conveys emotion instead of information. Therefore, it is conceivable that clear information is difficult to be selected and the emotion of a powerful trend may gather more people who lack thorough thinking.

Therefore, I made this project and tried to disply this phenomenon in an abstract method.
The limited size of the canvas represents the cognitive limitation of most ordinary people while the different colours represent different people.
