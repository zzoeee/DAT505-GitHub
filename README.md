## Session1
This file includes two projects which are called 00-Test and 01-TestX respectively.

The project named 00-Test is an example of rotationg cube provided by professor during the class.

The project named 01-TestX is my homework. Firstly, My homework shows a black-and -white rotationg sphere together with some toruses rotationg at different speed.
Then, after the lesson of material, I changed the material of my first homework and submitted it as my second homework.

## Session2
This file includes four files called 00-ExerciseSOLVED, 01-BasicMaterial, 02-MaterialTest and 03-COPY-Three,JS-Materials respectively.

I changed the texture of the cube in the No.00 file and changed the material of cubes in the No.02 project according to the codes provided in the No.01 file. Besides, I run the example of the website by my own server successfully in the No.03 file.

## Session3
There are two examples about GUI provided by professor during the class.

## Session4 & Seesion5
There are a homework called ArrayMesh-Exercise-template and an example called S4-ArrayMesh in the Session4 file.

The homework shows some cubes rotating in different angles and the example is about array and rotation.

I did an exercise in the Session5 according to the example provided in the Session 4, which shows different geometries zoomingï¼Œchanging colors and rotating in different angles and speed.

## Session6
This file includes an example and I did an exercise based on it during the class. I changed the geometries into wireframe and did some work to make it look the same as the picture provided on the class.

## Session7
This file includes an example called Texture-Cube and a homework called Eyes-Interaction which shows some eyes appearing in the random position and watching the position where your mouse is.

## Session8
This file includes three projects called exercise, S8-00-Texture-Eyes-Interaction2X and S8-02-objLoader-Raycasting repectively.

The exercise I did on the class is to change the color of graph randomly when you move your mouse on it. Besides, when you click it, the information of scale will appear in the console.

The file of raycasting shows the way of inputing models.

The file of Eye-Interaction shows a more accurate way of letting the eyes to see the position where the mouse is.

## Session9
This file includes two projects called S9-01-RaycastAudio and S9-02-PostProcessing-Glitch respectively.

The first file shows the way of playing some music by moving mouse on it.

The second file shows the way of chanding the shader of the geometries.
